# Dog Breed Classifier with CNN

## 1. Synopsis

In this project, I implement classifier that can identify whether a input image is human, dog and what breed is it, or something else using CNN. These are techniques and tools I use:

- Tensorflow: Deep Learning library from Google
- Keras: A API for different libraries to build Deep Learning model
- OpenCV: A library for Computer Vision tasks
- Pre-trained model: A state-of-the-art models in Image Recognition Field. In this project I use VGG16 and ResNet50

I also use following libraries: Numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, and random
